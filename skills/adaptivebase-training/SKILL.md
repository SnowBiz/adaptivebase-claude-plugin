name: adaptivebase-training
description: Use when a connected AdaptiveBase athlete or coach wants to begin training, establish baselines, log completed sets, review progress, check daily sleep and recovery, identify gym equipment, adapt a program, or propose training for a consenting client. Do not use for unrelated questions or generic fitness advice without an AdaptiveBase request.

# AdaptiveBase training

AdaptiveBase stores authoritative facts; the AI supplies conversation and reasoning.
Retrieve current records instead of relying on conversation memory. Only a successful
result proves a change. Never claim an attempted or failed write was saved.

## Connect and discover

Discover the 15 plugin tools and exact schemas. Use the names in the bundled
[tool contracts](references/tools.md); the plugin endpoint does not use the native
AgentCore prefix. Grouped tools take `action`, `input`, and, for writes, a unique
UUID `idempotencyKey`. Live discovery wins over bundled contracts.

Use `get_profile` to identify the account and `get_training_status` to check setup.
If `requiresSetup`, direct the user to the returned `setupUrl`. Early access approval,
sign-in, setup, and connector entitlement are distinct. Never request passwords,
codes, tokens, payment details or keys in chat. AI-provider plans are separate.

## Baseline and daily check-in

1. `get_training_status` returns `context`, `baselines`, or a setup link. Missing
   programs or measurements mean unknown, not zero or a saved recommendation.
2. Ask goals, experience, schedule, session length, equipment, units/timezone, pain
   and restrictions. `manage_training_plan` action `profile` saves only supported
   profile fields; do not invent goal or injury fields outside the schema.
3. Agree conservative, submaximal baseline assessments. Use `record_readiness`
   action `assessment` with reported results, protocol and explicit units. Skipping
   is valid. Never fabricate clearance or require painful or maximal efforts.
4. Explain the starting plan and uncertainty. Only after agreement use
   `manage_training_plan` action `update` with current expectedVersion and reason.

At the first training interaction of each local day, inspect `context.dailyCheckIn`.
For missing health, offer accessible measurements or reported sleep. Use
`record_readiness` action `health` with local wake date, timezone, source and stable
source record ID; include only known measurements. This does not read Apple Health.
Keep HRV SDNN and RMSSD distinct; never sum competing sources. For missing recovery,
ask subjective sleep quality, energy, motivation, soreness and pain; action `recovery`
requires actual reported facts. Honor declines, never block workouts or repeatedly
ask for today's recorded data. Measurements provide context, not a diagnosis.

## Work out and record

1. Read `get_today_workout`, status, current gym and recent exercise performance.
   Review pain/recovery and confirm the intended workout.
2. Resume an existing active session using `get_workout`; otherwise use
   `record_workout` action `start` to snapshot the agreed prescription.
3. Action `set` records completed work only. Resolve canonical exercise/session/set
   IDs from retrieved records. Clarify load units, reps and required RIR; RPE alone
   does not supply every required fact. API loads use pounds; convert kilograms
   explicitly. Distinguish prescribed and performed work.
4. Sets are immutable: there is no update_set. Explain correction limitations;
   do not duplicate a set or claim it was edited.
5. Action `exercise_complete` needs athlete confirmation. Action `complete` needs
   confirmation that the session is finished and reported session RPE. Never
   invent session RPE. Actions `run` and `mobility` record their required facts.

Reuse the same idempotencyKey and identical arguments on retries of one logical
write. Never add userId or infer access to another account. Reload on version
conflict and ask again if the proposal changes. Do not diagnose pain or prescribe
treatment; stop painful activity and direct concerning symptoms to professional care.

## Equipment, programs and coaches

Read [equipment and travel](references/equipment.md) for private photos and gyms.
Use published exercise IDs from `browse_exercises`, confirmed inventory, known load
limits and reported constraints. Rankings are not medical clearance or guarantees.

Read adaptationPolicy: FIXED means portal edits; GUIDED means
`manage_training_plan` action `propose` and athlete portal approval; FLEXIBLE permits
only enabled bounded changes. Do not loosen controls or replace a plan to evade them.
A saved template or proposed program is not an active program.

Read [coach workflows](references/coaching.md) for client work. Server-side consent
is required even for administrators. `get_progress` supplies deterministic analytics,
records and trends; `get_exercise_history` supplies actual sets. Use returned metrics,
not invented percentages or graphs. Estimated 1RM is not a measured maximum.
